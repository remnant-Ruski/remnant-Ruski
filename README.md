## 88! Welcome to my profile, Iron march shall continue in glory!

<details>

<summary>A summery of whom/what I am.</summary>
  
***this is made for my unending suffering of my alter-ego which formed when i left the National Socialist movment in 2023, his/my name is Ruski.
I do not know if i can call him an alter-ego as he acts as a seperate entity in my head and seperate from myself, I might just be schizophrenic and the
voice(s) in my head are just acting as him or I am suffering from onset split personality disorder. I do not know, I am not sure, neither do I care
anymore. I am just using this as a way to diary, and tho i may not know how to work github, I will figure it out and make entries when I do***

<Details>
<summary> What and why am I doing</summary>
  
***What I am doing is journaling Ruski down and shareing it, I want to reflect on the voice that speaks for 3 years. Why? because its something to do,
and im in need of a way to idk cope? no? yes?, I just want answers as to why he persists on staying and how he formed to be in my head.***
